## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I have to use the "Build Now" button to trigger a build?

No, you don't have to use the "Build Now" button.  You can invoke your projects build URL to kickoff a build with a simple HTTP Post.  The most common way to enable continuous integration is to have your repository invoke your projects build url whenever a change is committed.  Take a look at the guide [Triggering Builds](/triggers.html).

### How much does it cost for Open Source projects?

There is a free tier for open source projects.  There are a few limits on the free tier, but the majority of open source projects shouldn't be hitting the limits.  Please contact us if you have an open source project that is running into the limits.
