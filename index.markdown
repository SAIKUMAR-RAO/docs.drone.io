Drone.io is a hosted continuous integration service.  It enables you to conveniently set up projects to automatically build, test, and deploy as you make changes to your code.  Build artifacts can be archived and made available for download.

It works with Git, Bazaar, Mercurial, and Subversion, for both public and private repositories on sites like Github, Bitbucket, Google Code, and Launchpad.
